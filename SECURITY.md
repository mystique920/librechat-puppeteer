## Security Best Practices

When deploying this service:

1. **Access Control**: Limit access to the API endpoints using authentication and network controls
2. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource limits in Docker to prevent DoS conditions
3. **Network Isolation**: Use Docker network isolation to limit container communication
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep the service and its dependencies up to date
5. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for unusual activity or resource usage
