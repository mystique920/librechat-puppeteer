# MCP Integration Status Report

## Latest Update: March 15, 2025

This document tracks the current status of our Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration efforts for the Puppeteer service.

## Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| MCP SDK Integration | âœ… Completed | Successfully fixed SDK installation in Dockerfile |
| stdio Transport | âœ… Completed | Integration with LibreChat via Docker exec is working |
| SSE Transport | ðŸš§ Planned | Implementation plan created, not yet implemented |
| MCP Tools | âœ… Completed | Browser management, navigation, and screenshot tools working |
| MCP Resources | âœ… Completed | Browser, page content, and screenshot resources working |
| Documentation | âœ… Updated | README and MCP_INTEGRATION.md updated to reflect current state |

## Recent Achievements

1. **MCP SDK Installation Fix**: Successfully resolved the MCP SDK installation issues in the Dockerfile by:
   - Adding verbose installation and verification steps
   - Testing with Docker build and confirming successful image creation
   - Verifying MCP mode startup works correctly

2. **Docker Network Configuration**: Established proper dual-network connectivity:
   - Connection to LibreChat's network (`librechat_default`)
   - Connection to dedicated MCP services network (`mcp-services`)

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated README.md with current status and enhanced troubleshooting
   - Updated MCP_INTEGRATION.md with clearer instructions
   - Added documentation about upcoming SSE transport

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Current stdio Integration**: 
   - Test and verify the current stdio-based MCP integration with LibreChat
   - Document any issues or limitations encountered

2. **SSE Transport Implementation**:
   - Implement SSE transport according to `mcp-sse-implementation-plan.md`
   - Create test client for verification
   - Update server code to support the new transport method

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Improve error handling across all MCP integration points
   - Add better logging and diagnostics

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize resource usage in container
   - Improve concurrency handling for multiple simultaneous browser sessions

## Open Issues

1. **Browser Stability**: Need to investigate potential memory leaks with long-running browser instances
2. **Connection Reliability**: stdio transport can be unreliable in certain Docker configurations
3. **Error Propagation**: Improve how errors are communicated back to LibreChat

## Dependencies

- LibreChat version compatibility: Testing needed with latest versions
- Docker networking: Current implementation requires both services to be on the same network
- MCP SDK version: Currently using 1.7.0, may need updates as the protocol evolves

## Conclusion

The core MCP integration is now working successfully with the stdio transport method. The SSE transport implementation is planned and ready to be implemented when needed. We recommend focusing first on testing and verifying the current integration thoroughly before implementing the new transport layer.
