# System Patterns

This document captures architectural patterns, best practices, and system design decisions for the Puppeteer service project.

## Architectural Patterns

### REST API Design
- **Pattern**: Resource-oriented REST API with clear endpoint naming conventions
- **Implementation**: Use Express.js controllers with service layer separation
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use HTTP verbs semantically (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Return appropriate status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
  - Implement consistent error handling and response formats
  - Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns (logging, authentication)

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Pattern**: Real-time unidirectional data flow from server to client
- **Implementation**: Express SSE middleware with event emitter pattern
- **Best Practices**:
  - Implement reconnection logic
  - Use appropriate event naming conventions
  - Handle connection interruptions gracefully
  - Include event IDs for tracking

### Service Layer Pattern
- **Pattern**: Business logic encapsulation in service classes
- **Implementation**: TypeScript classes with clear interfaces
- **Best Practices**:
  - Single responsibility principle
  - Dependency injection
  - Error handling at the appropriate level
  - Async/await for asynchronous operations

### Browser Instance Management
- **Pattern**: Pool-based resource management for Puppeteer browser instances
- **Implementation**: Singleton service with instance tracking
- **Best Practices**:
  - Implement proper cleanup of resources
  - Set appropriate timeouts and limits
  - Monitor memory usage
  - Implement graceful shutdown

## Docker Best Practices
- Use multi-stage builds when appropriate
- Minimize image size by cleaning up after installations
- Implement proper health checks
- Use non-root users for security
- Properly manage environment variables
- Use volumes for persistent data

## Testing Patterns
- Unit testing for individual components
- Integration testing for API endpoints
- Docker container testing
- Performance and load testing
