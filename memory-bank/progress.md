## Blockers/Issues
- Multiple LibreChat networks detected - resolved by making the network configurable via environment variable
- Container startup failure - resolved by fixing volume mounts in docker-compose.yml
- Puppeteer initialization failure on Apple Silicon - resolved by using system-installed Chromium
- Network connectivity issues - resolved by using run-with-network.sh script to connect to the correct LibreChat network
- URL validation rejecting Docker hostnames - resolved by implementing a custom URL validator that accepts both standard URLs and Docker hostnames
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md corruption - resolved by creating a new file based on Contributor Covenant
