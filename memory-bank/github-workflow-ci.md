# GitHub Workflow for CI/CD

This document describes the proposed GitHub Actions workflow configuration for the Puppeteer service. When you're ready to implement CI/CD, you can use this as a reference to create the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

## Workflow Configuration

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint
        
      - name: Check TypeScript compilation
        run: npm run build:check
  
  test:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
  
  build:
    name: Build Docker Image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
        
      - name: Build Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: .
          push: false
          tags: puppeteer-service:test
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
      
      - name: Test Docker image
        run: |
          docker run --name puppeteer-test -d puppeteer-service:test
          sleep 5
          docker logs puppeteer-test
          docker rm -f puppeteer-test
  
  # Integration tests could be added here in the future
  
  # Deployment could be added here in the future
```

## Workflow Explanation

This workflow includes three main jobs:

1. **Lint**: Checks code quality and TypeScript compilation
   - Uses ESLint to enforce code style
   - Verifies that TypeScript compiles without errors

2. **Test**: Runs unit and integration tests
   - Executes tests using the project's test framework

3. **Build**: Tests Docker image building
   - Builds the Docker image to verify the Dockerfile works
   - Runs the container briefly to check for startup errors

## Future Enhancements

As the project matures, the workflow could be extended with:

1. **Integration Tests**: More comprehensive tests that verify MCP functionality
2. **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging environments
3. **Version Management**: Automatic version tagging and release management
4. **Security Scanning**: Container vulnerability scanning
5. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks and performance regression tests

## Prerequisites for Implementation

Before implementing this workflow, ensure:

1. The project has proper linting configured
2. Tests are implemented and can run in CI environment
3. Any environment variables needed for testing are properly documented
4. The Dockerfile is optimized for CI building

## Implementation Steps

1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the above content
2. Test the workflow by pushing to a branch
3. Review and adjust as needed
4. Enable branch protection rules requiring CI to pass
