# Will LibreChat Have Access to Puppeteer Tools?

## Technical Analysis

**Yes, LibreChat will have the Puppeteer tools available** once properly connected, with two key requirements:

1. The Puppeteer service must be running and accessible on the network
2. LibreChat must be configured with the correct environment variables

## How It Works Technically

1. **LibreChat Configuration**:
   - LibreChat uses environment variables (`PUPPETEER_SERVICE_URL` and `ENABLE_PUPPETEER_SERVICE`) to detect and connect to external services
   - When these variables are set, LibreChat will attempt to connect to the specified service URL

2. **Network Communication**:
   - Both services must be on the same Docker network (in this case, `librechat_default`)
   - Docker's internal DNS resolves the container name `puppeteer-service` to its IP address
   - LibreChat makes HTTP requests to the Puppeteer service API endpoints

3. **Service Discovery**:
   - No additional service discovery mechanism is needed
   - Docker's built-in DNS handles service discovery based on container names

## Implementation Plan for Your Setup

Since you have the projects in separate directories (~/LibreChat and ~/Puppeteer), your proposed approach is correct:

### 1. Start Puppeteer Service First

```bash
# Navigate to the Puppeteer directory
cd ~/Puppeteer

# Start the service with the LibreChat network
./run-with-network.sh librechat_default
```

### 2. Update LibreChat's Configuration

Edit ~/LibreChat/docker-compose.override.yml to add the Puppeteer environment variables:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    # Existing volumes remain unchanged
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./librechat.yaml
        target: /app/librechat.yaml
      - type: bind
        source: /Users/black/obsidian_vault/mystique
        target: /obsidian-vault
      - type: bind
        source: ./files
        target: /app/files
      - type: bind
        source: /Users/black/LibreChat/mcp-servers
        target: /app/mcp-servers
    environment:
      #  - BRAVE_API_KEY=${BRAVE_API_KEY}
      #  - NODE_ENV=production
      # Add these lines for Puppeteer integration
      - PUPPETEER_SERVICE_URL=http://puppeteer-service:3000
      - ENABLE_PUPPETEER_SERVICE=true
  
  # Keep the existing metrics service unchanged
  metrics:
    image: ghcr.io/virtuos/librechat_exporter:main
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### 3. Start LibreChat

```bash
# Navigate to the LibreChat directory
cd ~/LibreChat

# Start the stack
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Verify Connectivity

```bash
# Check if LibreChat can reach the Puppeteer service
docker exec librechat-api curl -s http://puppeteer-service:3000/health
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Correct Dependency Order**: Ensures the Puppeteer service is available when LibreChat starts
2. **Clean Project Separation**: Maintains independent projects without unnecessary coupling
3. **Reliable Discovery**: Uses Docker's DNS for service discovery rather than custom mechanisms
4. **Simplified Configuration**: Minimal changes to LibreChat's configuration

## Conclusion

Your approach of starting the Puppeteer service first and then booting up LibreChat is the correct strategy. With the proper network configuration and environment variables, LibreChat will successfully connect to the Puppeteer service and have access to its browser automation tools.
